        <h1>Shirjeel Khalil Fahid</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am freelance Web Developer who is also a qualified English solicitor
          and possess several years' legal and business work experience in varied
          fields, specialising in Fintech and Cyber Security, and am interested in
          applying my skills and experience to a role in software development.

          <p>Having graduated from the University of Cambridge (MA Cantab, Classics),
            I went on to complete the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL), Legal Practice
            Certificate (LPC), and Professional Skills Course (PSC) from the University
            of Law (London Moorgate), and most recently completed the Oxford Blockchain
            Strategy Programme from the Saïd Business at the University of Oxford, which
            explored the ways in which blockchain technology may impact the future of
            business and society.</p>

          <p>Since university, I worked in several law firms and also in business, acting as general
            manager and legal consultant for a successful education company based in Monaco, incorporated
            and helped run a successful legal services business, before working in payments in an
            Analyst role where I was responsible for producing key policy documents for steering committees
            relating to legal and regulatory compliance with the Mastercard and Visa Card Scheme Rules, as
            well as important legislation such as the EU's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).</p>

          <p>I have most recently worked in the management team of a Nasdaq-listed Cyber Security
            company, as Legal Counsel and Board Secretary, and during this time completed
            several important corporate acquisitions, and provided legal and business support
            for a business comprising 350 employees with multiple subsidiaries in Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa. The business increased both its organic growth and acquisitional value
            from a revenue of €17m in 2017 to €70m in 2019. I also gained experience in both maintaining
            a listing and the process for listing on a major exchange (Nasdaq in New York), as well as
            negotiations for capital raises involving several million Euros and key commercial contracts,
            such as Cyber1 becoming the exclusive Cyber Security provider for Formula 1.</p>

          <p>I am now focussed on further developing my web development and software
            engineering skills in order to work in this field wherein I hope to be
            able to draw on both my previous and current knowledge and experience in the interrelated
            fields of business, technology and legal compliance.</p>
